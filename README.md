# IR-Feedback
This an IR Feedback Project related to Home Automation Systems using ESP8266 NODEMCU.

In home Automation System you can any AC or IR device but if you control it from it's own remote you won't have any indication in your system about about what happen or what have been done with the main remote.

so you can apply this code to any home automation system you want because it run through API of your HUB.

First thing you want to do is know what is the IR code I reciever to put it into code 

So setup your ESP on Arduino IDE 

Connect the IR reciever with your ESP then upload simple code to it to recieve IR codes

After you know every codes you want to control it write it down to the code of IR Feedback file

In IR feedback code you will need green led & red led 

Green led :: indication for connecting to your WI-FI

Red led :: Indicate that you have recieve from Remote

After that you would like to make PCB layout Or you can just make all wiring on bread board.

you will find Folder has PCB layout.
